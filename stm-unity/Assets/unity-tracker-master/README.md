# Unity tracker

![logo_rage_top-of-the-web](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5657407/16461800/9ae669fc-3e2e-11e6-97f4-4e93f2c96dea.jpg)

This code belongs to [RAGE project](http://rageproject.eu/) and sends analytics information to a server; or, if the server is currently unavailable, stores them locally until it becomes available again.

After a game is developed, a common need is to know how the players play, what interactions they follow within the game and how much time they spend in a game session; collectively, these are known as game analytics. Analytics are used to locate gameplay bottlenecks and assess  game effectiveness and learning outcomes, among other tasks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository in your **Assets** folder inside your Unity project
1. Add the [Tracker MonoBehaviour](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Tracker/Tracker.cs) into an empty object in your first scene (the component will be kept across scenes)
	![unitytracker add tracker](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5657407/21893124/07974d46-d8da-11e6-9168-e1cb0e7547f1.png)
1. Configure the component parameters
  1. **Flush interval**: time between each flush of the tracker to the server. If this is set to `-1`, it will be necessary to call `T().RequestFlush()` to send traces to the server.
  1. **Storage type**: can be `net`, to send traces to a server, o `local`, to store them locally.
  1. **Trace format**: the format of the traces. Can be `csv`, `json` or `xapi`.
  1. **Host**: If storage type is set to `net`, this should have the host for the analysis server
  1. **Tracking code**: If storage type is set to `net`, this is the [tracking code identifying the game](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Tracking-code)
  1. **Debug**: Enable to see tracker messages in the Unity console.
1. Send traces

The configuration process is very simple. If a game is exported, a track.txt file has to be created in the root project directory, into an Asset folder.

The [track.txt](https://github.com/e-ucm/QuizDemo/blob/master/Assets/Assets/track.txt) file must be edited changing the `host` and `trackingCode` 
with the correct values. Normaly the `host` looks like this `http://localhost:3000/api/proxy/gleaner/collector/` and the `trackingCode` normally looks like [this](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Tracking-code).

<b>Note</b>: The traces file are saved in `C:/Users/[username]/AppData/LocalLow/[Company Name]/[Product Name]` under the name `traces.csv`

If you are not sure or you donâ€™t know your company and product name, you can check and change it the path using the Unity menu:
`Edit > Project Settings > Player`

## MonoBehaviour Example

```c#
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class TraceGeneratorsScript : MonoBehaviour {

	void Start () {
		Tracker.T.accessible.Accessed("Scene1");
		Tracker.T.setScore(0);
	}

	void Update () {	
	}
}
```

## Detailed Feature List
1. Configurable flush intervals (via `T().SetFlushInterval()`; use `-1` to entirely avoid auto-flush). If flushing fails, for example due to transient network problems, the tracker will periodically attempt to re-send the data. 
1. Different storage types: 
	1. `net`: sends data to a trace-server, such as the [rage-analytics Backend](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics-backend). If set, a hostname should be specified via the `host` property.
	2. `local`, to store them locally for later retrieval. Un-sent traces are always persisted locally before being sent through the net, to support intermittent internet access.
1. Different trace formats:
	2. `csv`: allow processing in MS Excel or other spreadsheets. Also supported by many analytics environments.
	3. `json`: especially intended for programmatic analysis, for instance using python or java/javascript or
	4. `xapi`: an upcoming standard for student activity. Note that, if the tracker's storage type is `net` it is required to use the `xapi` trace format since the [rage-analytics Backend](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics-backend) expects xAPI Statements. The [xAPI tracking model] (https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-seriousgames) that the backend expects is composed of [Completables](https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-seriousgames/blob/master/README.md#1341-completable), [Reachables](https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-seriousgames/blob/master/README.md#1341-reachable), [Variables](https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-seriousgames/blob/master/README.md#1342-variables) and [Alternatives](https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-seriousgames/blob/master/README.md#1343-alternatives). 
1. Tracker messages can be displayed in the Unity console by setting the `Debug` property
1. Uses Unity's in-built facilities to handle connections, files and timing.
 
### User Guide

The tracker requires (if `net` mode is on) the [RAGE Analytics](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics) infrastructure up and running. Check out the [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Quickstart) and follow the `developer` and `teacher` steps in order to create a game and [setup a class](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Set-up-a-class). It also requires a:

* **Host**: where the server is at. This value usually looks like `<rage_server_hostmane>/api/proxy/gleaner/collector/`. The [collector](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Back-end-collector) is an endpoint designed to retrieve traces and send them to the analysis pipeline.
* **Tracking code**: an unique tracking code identifying the game. [This code is created in the frontend](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Tracking-code), when creating a new game.


The tracker exposes an API designed to collect, analyze and visualize the data. The  API consists on defining a set of **game objects**. A game object represents an element of the game on which players can perform one or several types of interactions. Some examples of player's interactions are:

* start or complete (interaction) a level (game object)
* increase or decrease (interaction) the number of coins (game object)
* select or unlock (interaction) a power-up (game object)

A **gameplay** is the flow of interactions that a player performs over these game objects in a sequential order.

The main typed of game objects supported are:

* [Completable](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Tracker/Format/CompletableTracker.cs) - for Game, Session, Level, Quest, Stage, Combat, StoryNode, Race or any other generic Completable. Methods: `Initialized`, `Progressed` and `Completed`.
* [Accessible](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Tracker/Format/AccessibleTracker.cs) - for Screen, Area, Zone, Cutscene or any other generic Accessible. Methods: `Accessed` and `Skipped`.
* [Alternative](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Tracker/Format/AlternativeTracker.cs) - for Question, Menu, Dialog, Path, Arena or any other generic Alternative. Methods: `Selected` and `Unlocked`.
* [TrackedGameObject](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Tracker/Format/GameObjectTracker.cs) for Enemy, Npc, Item or any other generic GameObject. Methods: `Interacted` and `Used`.

##### Completable

Usage example for the tracking of an in-game quest. We decided to use a [Completable](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Format/CompletableTracker.cs) game object for this use-case as the most suitable option:

```c#

	// Completable
	// Initialized
	Tracker.T.completable.Initialized("MyGameQuestId", Completable.Quest);
	
	//...
	
	// Progressed
	Tracker.T.completable.Progressed("MyGameQuestId", Completable.Quest, 0.8);
	
	//...
	
	// Progressed
	bool success = true;
	Tracker.T.completable.Completed("MyGameQuestId", Completed, success);

```

##### Accessible

Usage example for the tracking the player's movement through some in-game screens and skipping the `Intro` cutscene:

```c#
	
	// Accessible
	// The player accessed the 'MainMenu' screen
	Tracker.T.accessible.Accessed("MainMenu", Accessible.Screen);
	
	//...
	
	// The player skipped a cutscene
	Tracker.T.accessible.Skipped("Intro", Accessible.Cutscene);

```

##### Alternative

Usage example for the tracking the player's choices during a conversation:

```c#
	
	// Alternative
	// The player selected the 'Dan' answer for the question 'What's his name?'
	Tracker.T.alternative.Selected("What's his name?", "Dan", Alternative.Question);
	
	//...
	
	// The player selected 'OK' for the question 'Do you want it?'
	Tracker.T.alternative.Selected("Do you want to start right now?", "OK", Alternative.Question);

	//...
	
	// The player unlocked 'Combat Mode' for the menu 'Menues/Start'
	Tracker.T.alternative.Unlocked("Menues/Start", "Combat Mode", Alternative.Menu);
	
```

##### Tracked Game Object

Usage example for the tracking the player's with a NPC villager and using a health potion (item):

```c#
	
	// Tracked Game Object
	// The player interacted with a Non Playable Character
	Tracker.T.trackedGameObject.Interacted("NPC/Villager", TrackedGameObject.Npc);
	
	//...
	
	// The player used a health potion
	Tracker.T.trackedGameObject.Used("Item/HealthPotion", TrackedGameObject.Item);
	
```

Note that in order to track other type of user interactions it is required to perform a previous analysis to identify the most suitable game objects ([Completable](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Format/CompletableTracker.cs), [Accessible](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Format/AccessibleTracker.cs), [Alternative](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Format/AlternativeTracker.cs), [TrackedGameObject](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Format/GameObjectTracker.cs)) for the given case. For instance, in order to track conversations [Alternative](https://github.com/e-ucm/unity-tracker/blob/master/Assets/Format/AlternativeTracker.cs) is the best choice

### Tracker and Collector Flow
If the storage type is `net`, the tracker will try to connect to a `Collector` [endpoint](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Back-end-collector), exposed by the [rage-analytics Backend](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics-backend). 

More information about the tracker can be found in the [official documentation of rage-analytics] (https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/Tracker).
